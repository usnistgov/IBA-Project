## Test data
Each set of tests contains a points list outlining the points used in the controllers and the ibal. Points that are read from the VCBT controllers and then used in the IBAL have a read_1_write_2 value of 1; the points written to the controllers from the IBAL
have a value of 2 in that column. The detailed addressing information have been removed from this file. This points list is read into the IBAL control program and then converted into a format that can be read by the BACnet DLL.
