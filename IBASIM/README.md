## Cases
The DOE BENEFIT 2019 project, Hardware-in-the-loop Flexible Load Testbed (HILFT), generated datasets to demonstrate how the HVAC in commercial buildings can be used to support grid needs. This study examined different control approaches in four climate zones. A co-simulation platform was developed that couples MATLAB based control scripts with an EnergyPlus building model. This simulation was integrated with the IBAL - the IBAL provided the simulation with the sensor measurements of the performance of real HVAC equipment and the simulation provided the IBAL with zone loads, weather, and some setpoints. The cases were modified to work with the TRNSYS model.
